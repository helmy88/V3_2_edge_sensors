Project Name: Edge Sensor Status Tester

Description:
This project involves an Arduino code that interfaces with two edge sensors to test their statuses. The code reads the state of the edge sensors and displays their status (edge detected or no edge detected) on the Serial Monitor.

1. Requirements:
- Two edge sensors (e.g., limit switches, IR sensors)
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- USB cable for connecting the Arduino to your computer

2. Installation:
- Connect the left edge sensor's signal pin to the appropriate digital pin on the Arduino (leftEdgeSensorPin in the code).
- Connect the right edge sensor's signal pin to another appropriate digital pin on the Arduino (rightEdgeSensorPin in the code).
- Connect the Arduino to your computer using the USB cable.

3. Usage:
- Upload the provided Arduino sketch to your Arduino board.
- Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to view the edge sensor statuses.
- The Serial Monitor will display whether an edge is detected or not for each sensor.

4. Edge Sensor Behavior:
- The code reads the state of the left and right edge sensors.
- If a sensor's state is HIGH, it indicates that an edge is detected, and "Edge Detected!" will be displayed.
- If the state is LOW, "No Edge Detected" will be displayed.

5. Troubleshooting:
- Double-check the wiring connections between the edge sensors and the Arduino.
- Ensure that the correct pins are specified in the code for reading each sensor's signal.
